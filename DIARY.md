## Project Diary

`4.10.2025`: Started the project by creating the high-level system design diagram depicting the resources that I will use/need to implement my system. Moreover, I specified my functional and non-functional goals for the project.

`5.10.2025`: I continued by starting to create my design system on Figma, setting up my branding, colours, icons, typography, and components.

`6.10.2025`: Some project management, I setup a project on Github for monitoring the tasks through a Kanban board containing three task columns: To-Do, In Progress, Done. Next step would be to continue to system flow diagrams.
